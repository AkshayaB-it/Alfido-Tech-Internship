Alfido Tech Data Science Internship
📘 Overview

This project is part of my Task 2 in the Alfido Tech Data Science Internship.
The goal of this project is to analyze loan applicant data and build a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan will be approved.

📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading

Loaded the dataset using Pandas

Checked rows, columns, missing values, and data types

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed visual and statistical analysis:

Loan Status distribution

Applicant Income analysis

Education vs Loan status

Credit history impact

Correlation heatmap

Boxplots for outlier detection

3️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled/normalized features (if required)

4️⃣ Model Building

Implemented machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Compared performance and selected the best model.

5️⃣ Model Evaluation

Used:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, F1 Score

📊 Results

Successfully built a Loan Approval Prediction Model

Identified most important features:

Credit History

Applicant Income

Loan Amount

Education

Achieved good accuracy with Random Forest / Logistic Regression
